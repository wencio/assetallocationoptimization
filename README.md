# assetallocationoptimization


**Summary of the code:**
This code utilizes the "cvxpy" library to perform an asset allocation optimization in an investment portfolio. The goal is to find the optimal asset allocation that maximizes the expected portfolio return, given the expected returns of assets and their covariance matrix.

**Explanation of each line of code:**

1. `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library for numerical operations under the alias "np."

2. `import cvxpy as cp`: Imports the cvxpy library for solving convex optimization problems under the alias "cp."

3. Defines expected returns and a covariance matrix of assets as example data.

4. `n_assets = len(expected_returns)`: Computes the number of assets in the portfolio based on the length of the expected returns array.

5. `x = cp.Variable(n_assets)`: Defines a decision variable "x" representing the asset allocation in the portfolio. Optimization will seek optimal values for this variable.

6. `constraints = [x >= 0, cp.sum(x) == 1]`: Sets up constraints for the optimization. It requires that asset allocation be non-negative and that the sum of allocations equals 1 (fully invested portfolio).

7. `objective = cp.Maximize(expected_returns @ x)`: Defines the optimization objective function, which is to maximize the expected portfolio return. It uses matrix multiplication to compute the total expected return.

8. `problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)`: Creates the optimization problem by combining the objective function and constraints.

9. `problem.solve()`: Solves the optimization problem to find the optimal asset allocation that maximizes the expected return.

10. `optimal_allocation = x.value`: Retrieves the optimal asset allocation from the optimization problem's solution.

11. Prints the optimal asset allocation in the portfolio, displaying the percentage allocated to each asset.

In summary, this code performs asset allocation optimization to find the optimal combination of assets that maximizes the expected return of an investment portfolio, subject to non-negative allocation and fully invested portfolio constraints.
